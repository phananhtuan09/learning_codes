# Implementation Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains implementation notes for individual features. These docs track what code was written, why, and how it aligns with the plan.

## Implementation Documentation Workflow

### Creating Implementation Notes

Implementation notes are created automatically during `execute-plan`:

- Command: `.cursor/commands/execute-plan.md`
- Output: `docs/ai/implementation/feature-{name}.md`
- Template: `docs/ai/implementation/feature-template.md`

### Implementation Doc Structure

Each implementation doc follows the template structure:

- **Summary**: Brief description of overall solution approach
- **Changes**: Per-task entries with:
  - File paths and line ranges
  - Approach/pattern used
  - Brief description of changes
- **Edge Cases**: List of handled edge cases
- **Follow-ups**: TODOs or deferred work

### Purpose

Implementation docs serve as:

- **Audit trail**: What code was written for this feature
- **Review reference**: For code-review and check-implementation commands
- **Refactor guide**: Understanding what was done for future improvements

### Execution Discipline

- Provide a short status update before each meaningful action (1–3 sentences).
- Perform edits via file editing tools; avoid printing large code for copy-paste.
- After each batch of edits, run linter/type/build on changed files; auto-fix issues (up to 3 attempts) before requesting review.

## Template Reference

See `feature-template.md` for the exact structure required for implementation notes.
