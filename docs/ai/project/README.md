# Project Standards

## Purpose

This directory contains project-wide standards that govern code quality, structure, and conventions. These standards are used by the `code-review` command to validate code.

## Standards Documentation

### CODE_CONVENTIONS.md

Defines coding standards including:

- Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes, constants)
- Import order and formatting
- Function size and complexity guidelines
- Error handling strategy
- Test rules
- Comments policy

### PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

Defines project organization including:

- Folder layout and directory structure
- Module boundaries and dependency direction
- Design patterns in use
- Test file placement and naming
- Config/secrets handling

## Generating Standards

### Auto-Generation

Use the `generate-standards` command to auto-generate these files from your codebase:

- Command: `.cursor/commands/generate-standards.md`
- Output: Updates `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- Process: Analyzes codebase + brief Q&A to infer standards

### Manual Editing

Both files can be edited manually at any time. They are marked with a note indicating they can be auto-generated.

## Usage in Workflow

### Development Workflow (4 phases)

1. Plan: define goals, scope, and Acceptance Criteria; create a todo checklist from the plan before any coding.
2. Implementation: make small, shippable edits; provide status updates before actions; perform edits via file editing tools.
3. Testing: cover main and edge flows; run linter/type/build on changed files and auto-fix issues (up to 3 attempts).
4. Review: self-review; when todos are done and checks pass, provide a concise summary and ship.

### Code Review

The `code-review` command checks conformance to these standards and project structure:

- Reports violations of explicit rules
- Avoids subjective design opinions or performance guesses
- Focuses on adherence to conventions and structure

### Implementation

When implementing features (`execute-plan`), follow these standards:

- Adhere to naming conventions
- Respect module boundaries
- Follow error handling patterns
- Place tests according to structure rules

**Note**: These standards are project-specific and should reflect actual patterns in your codebase. Regenerate when codebase evolves significantly.
